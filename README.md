## [LIVE DEMO](https://pasha-log.github.io/coalition-frontend-challenge/)

## Description: 

This is my submission for a skills test as part of my job application for Coalition Technologies, Inc.'s front-end position. The assessment is designed to evaluate my ability to transform an Adobe Photoshop PSD into a static, single-page web application. The primary objective is to convert the provided PSD into a responsive single-page website. The carousel should adapt to various screen sizes, and on mobile devices, the tabs should transition into an accordion layout. You'll notice internal links on the page, 'History' and 'Team,' which allow users to navigate to their respective sections. 

## Tools Used: 

* [jQuery](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [Flickity](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
